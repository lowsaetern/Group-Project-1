# What Do I Do Now?

## Description
This app allows a user to input a task, designate it as a priority task or not, and then create a task list. 
If a user needs an item in order to complete their task, they can search for the item and purchase through a third-part website.


## Installation
To install the project, we coded everything from scratch. We used a lot of references from other projects as well as google. Once complete, we published with github. 

## Usage
For people who may be overwhelmed by seeing a whole list of tasks they need to complete, allowing them to focus on one at a time could improve productivity and allow them to actually get things done.
